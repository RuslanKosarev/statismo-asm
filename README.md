# statismo-asm
Experimental ASM Fitting code for statismo. 

*While the code is fully functional, the interface has not stabilized yet and is likely to change in the future.*



 # Building
 Building statismo-asm is done using the usual CMake workflow.
 It requires the latest version of [statismo](https:/github.com/statismo/statismo), which is currently found in the branch [vs2015](https://github.com/statismo/statismo/tree/vs2015).
 Furthermore, to compile statismo-asm, C++11 needs to be supported by the compiler. 
 
 
Statismo-asm is known to work on Windows (Visual studio 2015) and Linux (GCC).
